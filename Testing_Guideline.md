# Testing Guideline
Here are some instructions for the test cases and submission:

* First verify functional outputs of these benchmarks.
  * Run these benchmarks using your simulator and compare the results with the outputs given in the test folder. 
  * They should match for Part 1. 
  * Functional outputs mean the state of integer and floating point registers and values stored in memory addresses after completion of the simulation.
  * Note down in your submission which are matching and which are not and why so for each benchmark.
  * Justify in your submission the number of stalls and the total number of cycles.
  * Also mention if your simulator doesn't finish execution (goes on infinite loop) or gives error for any of these benchmarks.

* Mention detailed architectural assumptions along with design details of the implemented simulator in your report.

* For Part 2 or SMT, we are going to feed combinations of test cases 1 and 2, and 4 and 5. You will see the outputs of these in 12.out, 21.out, 45.out, and 54.out.
